  <h1>KLEE Open Projects</h1>
  <!--*********************************************************************-->

  This page lists a variety of open projects that are natural (and tractable)
  extensions of KLEE and things that we would love to see people work on.  If
  you are interested in tackling any of the projects, please mail
  <a href="klee-dev.html">klee-dev</a>
  with your ideas -- or even better, your patches!.</a> 

  <ul>
    <li>
      <em>Implement SMT support for Kleaver:</em>

      <p>We would like to make Kleaver (KLEE's constraint solver) a more viable
      standalone product. One of the steps in this direction is to implement SMT
      support. This would also allow us to enter Kleaver into
      the <a href="http://www.smtcomp.org/2011/">SMT-COMP</a> theorem prover
      competition, which would be a good proving ground for our optimizations
      and benchmarking our underlying constraint solver (STP, currently) against
      other implementations.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <em>Distributed Constraint Solving:</em>

      <p>Much of the execution time of KLEE is spent inside the constraint
      solver. A natural extension would be to implement support for a
      distributed constraint solver, which would run KLEE on a single machine,
      but would farm out the constraints to be solved on a network of
      machines.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <em>Improve User Interface:</em>

      <p>This is not a very glamorous project, but it is still
      important. Currently, KLEE has a myriad of command line options and flags,
      most of which are left over from its research project roots. In order to
      promote KLEE's use as a user tool, we would like to clean up most of the
      UI so that the default behavior matches best practice, and so that more
      arcane or research-only options are hidden by default.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <em>Experiment With Other Constraint Solvers:</em>

      <p>For the most part, KLEE has been written so that it is possible to swap
      in other constraint solvers, but we have never tried anything other than
      STP. We would love to see the results of using other contraint solvers
      (like Yices or Z3) with KLEE.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <em>Implement Expression Level Constraint Optimization:</em>

      <p>KLEE does not currently do much optimization of constraint expressions
      before sending them to the constraint solver. We would like to have an
      internal framework for doing optimization of constraint expressions (e.g.,
      (A & ~A) => 0) so that these optimizations are only done once instead of
      on every solver query.</p>

      <p>In general, because KLEE is dealing with expressions which result from
      dynamic execution traces, many expressions end up having constant
      components. This means we can frequently apply the same optimizations a
      compiler would do, but to much greater effect because we are more likely
      to see constant values. For reference, see the kinds of optimizations done
      by LLVM's InstCombine
      pass <a href="http://llvm.org/viewvc/llvm-project/llvm/trunk/lib/Transforms/InstCombine/">here</a>.</p>

      <p>The bulk of this project involves defining a good framework for us to
      apply optimizations to expressions, and for deciding when to attempt to
      optimization expressions.</p>
